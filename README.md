# MSc-Dissertation

This is the repository for my MSc dissertation code and data!

The data was created using content analysis on children's drawings of what they think COVID-19 looks like (drawings are not included in this dataset). The analysis consists of ten non-parametric Wilcoxon tests to see how age impacts children's accuracy in their understanding of COVID-19 within the framework of the Common Sense Model of Illness (CSM). This repo will not be updated after 12 pm August 7th 2025. Publication pending...

This research project was submitted as a portion of my MSc in Mental Health in Children and Young People from the University of Edinburgh.

The <a href="https://github.com/freyamurray/MSc-Dissertation/blob/main/content_analysis.md">markdown</a> versions of the files are most readable here on GitHub. I'm still trying to figure out how to have my visualisations included.
