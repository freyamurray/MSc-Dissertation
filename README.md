This is the repository for my MSc dissertation code and data!

The data was created using content analysis on children's drawings of what they think COVID-19 looks like (drawings are not included in this dataset). The analysis consists of ten non-parametric Wilcoxon tests to see how age impacts children's accuracy in their understanding of COVID-19 within the framework of the Common Sense Model of Illness (CSM). This repo will not be updated after 12 pm August 7th 2025.
